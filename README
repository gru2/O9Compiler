SourceFold is a compiler project. The main goal is to try an alternative approach to
get simpler and faster compiler that generates more efficient code than traditional
compilers. Also, a minimal effort should be required to add a new cpu architecture target.
This will be achieved by extensive use of auto-generated rewrite rules, iterative compilation,
machine learning and strongly theoretically founded methods like abstract interpretation.
